## Tech Stack

- Base: own OS layer built from scratch using [Wolfi packages](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os) via apko. Every package is explicitly declared in the Dockerfile.
- Frontend: [SvelteKit 2](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction), [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev), [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Backend: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime with SvelteKit API routes
- Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL via [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- Docker: direct docker API calls.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Bun installed. You can download it from [Bun's official website](https://bun.sh/).
2. Clone the repository (or your fork):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dockhand.git
   cd dockhand
   ```
3. Install dependencies using Bun:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the Bun output) to see the application running.

## Translations

UI texts live in `src/lib/i18n/messages/<locale>.json` ([Paraglide JS](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs), English is the source). In components, use `m.<key>()` from `$lib/paraglide/messages.js` instead of literal text; keys are snake_case with an area prefix (`containers_list_…`). To add a language, copy `en.json`, translate the values (keep `{placeholders}` as they are) and add the locale to `project.inlang/settings.json`. The UI follows the browser language; a key that a locale does not have yet falls back to English, so a translation can follow an area later. `bun test tests/i18n-messages.test.ts` checks that no locale has keys or placeholders that English does not have, and that the locales listed as complete in that test have every key.
